# dive-into-ant

in this project , im gonna go through the ant design UI library to use how well it is with react

# why antd ?

because is so poplar at the moment and more than 124 companies are using it in their production.

1. first we create react app using the commend line npx create-react-app dive-in-antd

2. to work with antd use either yarn or npm

$ npm install antd
$ yarn add antd

if you are trying to jump right away to code , sorry mate , that's not gonna work , you have to use one of these
import 'antd/dist/antd.css';
or
'antd/dist/antd.less'

before we start coding , i added some stuff for the sake of this project
i used font.google for choosing some beautiful fonts to add a pleasant view

you can link this in your "http://../public/index.html"

***
if you want to know how to override the properties of antd , 
check the index.js file , i wrote comment for you with what you should do.

we are gonna use sass
npm install node-sass
